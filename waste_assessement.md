# WASTE Management Quarterly Review Assessment

The survey is titled **"WASTE Management Quarterly Review Assessment"** and is structured to assess compliance on various waste management practices within a healthcare facility. It is divided into specific categories that track different aspects of waste management compliance.

## Purpose of the Survey

The primary goals of this survey are:

1. **Compliance Verification**: Ensures that healthcare facilities adhere to standard waste management protocols, including handling, treating, and disposing of waste.
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Proper waste management helps reduce risks of infection, contamination, and environmental harm, particularly important in healthcare environments where waste may be hazardous.
3. **Improvement Tracking**: Facilities can monitor progress over time by reviewing scores, identifying areas needing improvement, and supporting waste management policies and training efforts.

## Information Tracked by the Survey

The survey gathers detailed information across several key areas of waste management:

### 1. Treatment of Waste

- **Description**: This section covers items such as weighing waste, assessing the mechanical and functional status of the incinerator, monitoring incineration practices, ensuring area security, and verifying the availability of resources like diesel.
- **Score Calculation**:
  - Each item in this section corresponds to a scoring rule (e.g., Score 1.1, Score 1.2).
  - **Formula for Compliance**: Each item has a designated point value if compliant (e.g., 10 or 15 points), and non-compliance results in a score of zero.
  - **Sub-total for Section 1**: Sum of all individual scores (Score 1.1 + Score 1.2 + ... + Score 1.10).

### 2. Disposal of Waste

- **Description**: This includes items that verify the proper burial of waste, covering with soil, maintaining a safe distance from water sources, and the disposal of specific waste types (e.g., liquid, laboratory, ash).
- **Score Calculation**:
- Each question aligns with specific scoring criteria (e.g., Score 2.1, Score 2.2).
- **Formula for Compliance**: Each compliant item receives a specific score, while non-compliance results in zero.
- **Sub-totals**:
  - Sub-score for selected items (e.g., Score 2.1 + Score 2.2).
  - Total for Section 2: Sum of all scores (Score 2.1 + Score 2.2 + Score 2.4 + ... + Score 2.9).

### 3. General Facility Cleanliness and Maintenance

- **Description**: This section evaluates the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the facility, including cleanliness of grounds, condition of drainage and sewer systems, and availability and cleanliness of toilets.
- **Score Calculation**:
  - Each question has a designated score for compliance (e.g., Score 3.1, Score 3.2).
    - **Formula for Compliance**: Similar to other sections, each compliant item receives a designated score, and non-compliance results in zero.
    - **Sub-total for Section 3**: Sum of all individual scores (Score 3.1 + Score 3.2 + ... + Score 3.10).
