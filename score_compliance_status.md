# Compliance Status Based on Scoring in Healthcare Waste Management

To determine compliance status in healthcare waste management based on scores, facilities can typically use a scoring framework that assigns status labels like "Compliant," "Non-compliant," and "Partially Compliant" according to specific performance thresholds.

## Score Ranges for Compliance Levels

- **Compliant**: Score between **220 and 275** (80% or more of the maximum score). A facility may be deemed compliant if it meets or exceeds a specific score threshold, indicating a high level of adherence to waste management standards.
- **Partially Compliant**: Score between **138 and 219** (50% to less than 80% of the maximum score). Scores within this range may indicate partial compliance, where the facility meets some requirements but needs improvement in certain areas.
- **Non-compliant**: Score between **0 and 137** (less than 50% of the maximum score). Scores below this threshold are generally classified as non-compliant, signaling significant issues with waste management practices that may pose risks to health and safety.

## Factors in Score Calculation

Compliance scoring can be based on various factors such as:

- Adherence to waste segregation protocols
- Storage and disposal practices
- Use of protective equipment
- Training for waste handlers

These factors are assessed against established guidelines, such as those from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, which emphasize the need for safe waste segregation, handling, and disposal processes to minimize environmental and health risks.

## Example of a Grading System

A common framework might grade facilities as follows:

- **Above 80%**: Compliant
- **50-79%**: Partially Compliant
- **Below 50%**: Non-compliant

These ranges can be adjusted based on local guidelines, risk levels, and specific compliance goals. This type of scoring helps set benchmarks for facility assessments, creating action plans, and targeting areas for improvement in healthcare waste management practices.
